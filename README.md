## Usage

If you know nothing about ```gulpjs``` and you care only about the source code, then, you can directly clone it from the branch named ```build``` using this command:

* ```git clone https://www.github.com/amaitou/TrueFix --branch build --single-branch TrueFix```
    
otherwise, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) pre-installed on your computer. so after installing it, just change the directory to the folder and run the following command to download a few dependencies.
    
* ```npm install```

by executing this command some of important dependencies which are responsible for the project's building are going to be installed and here are all of them:

* gulp
* gulp-autoprefixer
* gulp-clean-css
* gulp-concat-css
* gulp-imagemin
* gulp-livereload
* gulp-sass
* gulp-uglify
* sass
* gulp-html-minifier
* gulp-image
* gulp-pug
* static-server

after you have these dependencies installed properly, then create a folder with the name of ```build``` within ```TrueFix's folder``` direclty, then run the following command:
* ```gulp```

then start having fun with this website
